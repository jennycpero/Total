# Total

Total is an arithmetic puzzle game in terminal style, programmed using Python.

## How To Install
1. Go to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/jennycpero/Total) for Total.
2. Select the latest release note in the **Releases** section, located on the right side of the page.
3. Select the **total.exe** file below the **Assets** dropdown to begin downloading.
4. Open the **total.exe** file and start playing!

*Note: If you receive a popup from your antivirus software saying that it wants to reject the download, don't panic! Most of these popups provide an option to allow the download anyway. I swear it's not dangerous.*

## How To Play
In Total, you are first given a set of 10 numbers between 1 and 10, with its sum representing its "first total". A random number is then added to the first total to create a "second total", before finally being subtracted by another random number to generate the "third total". Using only the numbers in your set, and constricted by a random number of moves, you must use basic arithmetic to find your way back from your third total to your first total. 

If successful, the first occurrence of each number you used to return to your first total will be removed from your set, and the process repeats. **Your goal is to reduce your set to 0 numbers, a total of 0.**

But if you fail, two more numbers will be inserted into your set, increasing your total! Be careful!

### Things To Remember:
- Sometimes, the random numbers generated to create your second and third total may end up being the same number, meaning your first and third total will match from the start! This is called a 'cancel'. When this happens, if the number that caused this cancel is in your set, *all* occurrences of this number will be removed from your set! If the cancel number is not in your set, you can choose a different number to remove all occurrences of instead. 
- Use up as many numbers as you can!
- When you win Total, your score is presented. It serves no purpose other than bragging rights.
- No calculator is provided. Practice your arithmetic (I know I need to).
- Have fun!
